    <section class="section">
        <h2>What is Project Phoenix?</h2>
        <p>
            Project Phoenix is a personal life-operating system designed to track, trace,
            and transform daily behavior into disciplined execution.
            This is not a public productivity app. It is built for one purpose:
            eliminating inconsistency and excuses.
